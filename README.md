something from reddit:\
Every criticism you get is a gift, seek them out. You are not your code. Beg for criticism. Even when they’re not right, trying to understand why they think they are is a valuable thought exercise. Start with the premise your wrong. Even if it’s not phrased constructively take the part you need (the feedback) and ignore how it’s delivered. Refusing to admit you’re wrong about something is a show of insecurity. Admitting you’re wrong about something (especially to a junior developer) is a flex that shows your knowledge/skills/authority isn’t challenged by new information.
